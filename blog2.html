                                <p>The ultimate goal of marketing is to match a company's products and services to the people who need and want them, thereby ensuring profitability.Email marketing is a very effective way to build relationships with your customers and sell your products or services. Studies have shown that it is more than 40 times more effective at acquiring new customers than Facebook or Twitter, and a great way to increase your marketing ROI. In fact, the average return on investment for an email marketing campaign is 4300%. This means that for every $1 spent, email marketing generates $43! Think of email marketing as a tool that allows you to communicate with your audience using targeted, relatable, and humanized content. Your goal shouldn't be to send as many promo emails to people as you can. Instead, you should use email marketing as a tool for building relationships with your audience. While marketers in the past used to rely on tools such as Excel spreadsheets and Outlook to manage their email marketing campaigns, today's email marketing software allows you to do so much more. In this article, we'll look at three email marketing tools you can use to manage your campaigns.

                                    The first email marketing software is called MailChimp.  MailChimp is the most popular marketing platform in the world, with around seven million users worldwide. The tool is perfect for small to medium-sized businesses who want to manage weekly or monthly newsletters, as well as regular campaigns.It also integrates with popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram, and features robust analytics that let you track every aspect of your campaign's performance. You can also use MailChimp's built-in email composer to customize your emails and select templates for messages. Constant Contact is another email marketing service you can use to make managing your email campaigns easier.Just like MailChimp, you can use it to manage your email lists, contacts, email templates, and campaign analytics.Two things that make Constant Contact stand out is its live chat support and extensive library of resources. They also offer online training and live seminars, so you can quickly start using it like a pro.The third email marketing software you can use to manage your campaigns is called AWeber.Aweber has all the features of MailChimp and Constant Contact including analytics, email template design, and list management.
